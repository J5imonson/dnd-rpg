We have created a text based combat game pulling inspiration from the TTRPG Dungeons and Dragons.

 Our first page will allow the player to enter any name for their choosen warrior in addition to on of the nine race options provided by our selected Api. 
 
 
 After both fields have been selected, you will start your text based journey encountering six unique foes. The selected warrior has the option of fighting, taking a healing potus, or fleaing from danger. Only the bravest and most stubborn will defeat Gary "The Barbarian"! 
 
 
 Death will cause a player to see their last page letting them know of their demise and giving them an option to replay the game. 
 
 
 No one has yet to see what happens if Gary "The Barbarian" is defeated... Will it be you?
