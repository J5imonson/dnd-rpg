[Beginnings]

"You awake alone in a forest, with only your weapon by your side..."

"The map lead you to these ruins. They look old, with crumbling walls blocking out the light."

"The temple invited you to stay within their hallowed halls, but there appears to be no one here."

&"This crypt smells.. like death... What did you expect?"

[Motivations]

&"The old man promised you treasure. He also promised you danger. So far, it has been mostly the latter..."

"Maybe your friend is around this next turn..."

"What's that? Who's there!?"

"Suddenly, a --insert monster here-- appears!"

"You slowly make your way furthur into the forest."

"You head down. Deeper. Deeper. And deeper still. You can sense the weight of the earth suspended mere feet above you."

"You press onwards. You must escape. As unlikely as that seems..."

&" ' I  want to be an adventurer," you said, 'It'll be fun!' "

&"What did I just step in? Ew! It's on my boots!"

[Death]

"Your weapon falls from your grip, your strength leaves you..."

"Your adventure ends here..."

"Aaagghh!" *death sounds*

&"You died. Ugh, what a mess..."

"Play again?"
